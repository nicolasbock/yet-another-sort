Description: A sort util that mimics the functionality of GNU `sort`
 This project leans heavily on, and aspires to eventually reach full feature
 parity with, GNU `sort`. The goal of this project is to experiment with
 additional features that are not part of GNU `sort`.

 The main purpose of this program is to write sorted concatenation of all
 file(s) to standard output.
